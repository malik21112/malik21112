## ðŸŒŸ ABOUT ME  

Hi! Iâ€™m Danish Malik, a Biomedical Engineering major from West Chester, Ohio. Growing up just north of Cincinnati, Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and healthcare, especially when it comes to developing innovative medical devices that can transform rehabilitation and improve patient outcomes.

Since joining Miami University in 2022, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work on a variety of exciting person and research projects, from hyperspectral imaging for autofluorescence detection to designing a 3D-printed prosthetic arm that uses flex sensors embedded in a glove to mirror hand movements. My interests span signal processing, embedded systems, medical imaging, and AI in biomedical applicationsâ€”essentially, anything that pushes the boundaries of rehabilitation technology and truly improves patients lives in anyway.  

Through these projects I have had a lot of opportunity to build my coding skills as I learned Javascript during my senior year of Highschool through AP computer Science principles, but since then I have learned and worked with many different programming languages. My main languages are C++, Verilog and python along with also experience with MATLAB, Arduino and Visual Studio Code. 
Beyond research, Iâ€™m actively involved in Engineers Without Borders, where Iâ€™ve gained valuable experience in cross-cultural collaboration and project management. As Grant Writing Chair, Iâ€™ve worked to secure funding for impactful initiatives. I also serve as President of SOURCE, where Iâ€™m dedicated to fostering a strong research community and helping fellow students explore their academic and career goals. Through my involvement in the Lilly Leadership Institute, Iâ€™ve come to believe in the power of leadership to drive meaningful change in healthcare and engineering.

Most recently, I took on the role of Secretary for the Miami University Robotics Club, where I help with mentoring students interested in building their projects while ensuring smooth club operations. I also work closely with the executive team to coordinate events, maintain the clubâ€™s online presence, and support corporate outreach initiatives, helping to create a collaborative space for robotics enthusiasts.

Iâ€™m always looking for new ways to apply critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills to real-world challenges. Check out my projects below, and [Linkedin](linkedin.com/in/muhammad-d-malik) for more information on what I have been up to!
